    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h2>
    <p>We started Granny’s Pie Factory because we knew that traditions could be centered around a family table and special food; and because we wanted our pies to start new family traditions while still honoring the old. We pride ourselves on crafting each of our pies with care and baking them until they reach perfection because at our table, family is always welcome, but the food has to earn its place</p>

    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Granny’s Pie Factory was founded in 2016 by Sifa and Blackshadow. While Sifa was a newcomer to the bakery business, Blackshadow had over 30 years of experience in restaurants, bakery and ice cream manufacturing, over 20 of which were spent focused entirely on pies. In 2018 their son Shelby joined the business bringing with him his passion for quality, and a desire to uphold and expand on the values on which his parents built their business.</p>

    <h2>OUR FUTURE</h2>
    <p>We continue to grow and expand our horizons while upholding our passion for honesty, quality and commitment to making an excellent product. We will continue to provide people with a reason to come together and enjoy their lives, each other and their family. Let our pies become a part of your family traditions.</p>
